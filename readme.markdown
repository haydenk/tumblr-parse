To Do:
===
1.  Make index, permalink, tag, search pages subclasses
2.  Fix audio posts
3.  Adjust swap_block to allow for multiple captures using array rather than hash
  
Someday Maybe:
===
1.  Add module to pull your posts from tumblr to generate file
2.  Change parsing engine to grab any block and process rather than looking for blocks to process
